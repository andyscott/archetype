# Archetype

Explorations of general recursion applied to Scalameta with the long term goal of
building a Scala code template engine.

This is very early stage and a work-in-progress.

The general recursion component may be split off into a separate library. The intention is for this library to have no additional dependencies other than Scalameta. Currently the Cats library is being used for the initial prototyping.
